"""Userspace-only TCP/IP + TLS stack fingerprint auditing (new, opt-in probe).

Architecture-review item 1 (2026-07-27): p0f-style stack fingerprinting and
JA3S/JA4S-style TLS fingerprinting, implemented **without raw sockets and
without root**, because UHBS's lab harness runs as an unprivileged process.

READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING ANY VALUE THIS MODULE RETURNS
=========================================================

True p0f fingerprints are built from the raw IP/TCP header of the SYN-ACK:
initial TTL, exact advertised window size *before* any OS-level clamping,
TCP option order (MSS, SACK, timestamps, window-scale — in the order the
peer sent them), and IP ID behavior. **None of that is obtainable from
Python's ``socket`` module on an unprivileged connect() on any platform
this harness targets** — the kernel's TCP stack has already consumed the
SYN-ACK by the time userspace code sees a connected socket. Achieving the
real thing requires either raw sockets (``SOCK_RAW``, needs root/
``CAP_NET_RAW``) or a packet-capture library such as ``scapy``/libpcap.
This module does **not** pretend otherwise: every TTL/exact-window/
option-order field p0f would normally use is intentionally absent here,
not stubbed with a fake value.

What *is* honestly obtainable from userspace and is implemented below:

  - TCP connect() latency (multiple samples → median + jitter) — a weak but
    real timing signal.
  - ``SO_RCVBUF``/``SO_SNDBUF`` as configured on *our own* local socket —
    informative only insofar as it reflects the local OS/Python defaults,
    NOT the peer's advertised window. Documented as such below.
  - ``TCP_NODELAY`` set/query round-trip (confirms the local stack accepted
    the option; says nothing about the peer).
  - On Linux only: ``getsockopt(IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_INFO, ...)``, a **kernel**
    sockopt (constant ``11``, stable across the range of Linux kernels this
    project cares about) that *does* expose real post-handshake telemetry —
    measured RTT/RTT-variance, the negotiated window-scale option, current
    congestion window, retransmit count — without needing raw sockets or
    root. This is the one genuinely p0f-adjacent signal we can get for
    free on Linux. It is unavailable on macOS/BSD (different, non-portable
    struct — ``TCP_CONNECTION_INFO`` — deliberately not reverse-engineered
    here) and is parsed defensively: if the returned bytes don't look like
    a plausible ``tcp_info`` struct (sane TCP state, bounded RTT), we
    report "unavailable" rather than surface a mis-parsed number that
    *looks* precise but isn't. TCP_INFO's exact struct layout has drifted
    slightly across kernel versions, so this must be treated as
    best-effort supplementary telemetry, never a scored gate on its own.

JA3S/JA4S — TLS ServerHello fingerprinting
===========================================

Real JA3S/JA4S hashes are built from the *raw bytes* of the ServerHello
message: negotiated cipher, TLS version, and the **exact order** of
extensions as the server sent them. Python's ``ssl`` module does not
expose raw handshake bytes — it terminates the TLS session and gives you
already-negotiated, already-reordered-by-openssl metadata
(``cipher()``, ``version()``, ``selected_alpn_protocol()``). Genuine
JA3S/JA4S therefore requires packet capture (e.g. scapy/tshark) and is
**out of scope for a userspace-only implementation** — this module does
not claim to produce a JA3S/JA4S hash. What it does instead is a
best-effort *approximation*: it records what ``ssl`` will tell us about a
single certificate-verified handshake using TLS 1.2 or newer. An
**opt-in** lab diagnostic (:func:`probe_tls_weak_cipher_acceptance`) can
additionally test whether the peer accepts intentionally weak ciphers
under TLS 1.2+; it is off by default and never changes UHQS.

Everything below is designed to be **opt-in**: :func:`fingerprint_host`
returns a single ``CheckResult``-shaped dict that a protocol plugin *could*
choose to call, but nothing here is wired into any plugin's default probe
path. That integration is deliberately left as follow-up work so this
module cannot silently change any existing pass/fail outcome.

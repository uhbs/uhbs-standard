# Related Deception Frameworks (Informative)

**Status:** Informative · evidence-graded comparison  
**UHBS version:** 4.5.2

This page compares UHBS with fourteen deception-evaluation frameworks, taxonomies,
and research model families. Entries are **not** all adopted standards. Each row
states evidence maturity, unit of analysis, and whether UHBS should adopt, experiment
with, map, or leave out of scope for UHQS.

UHBS answers: *how good and safe is this decoy implementation?*  
Many entries answer different questions (program maturity, campaign design, placement
strategy, topology). Their scores must not be merged into UHQS.

See also the optional [Advanced Evidence Profile (AEP)](../advanced-evidence/index.md)
for controlled **lab** comparative experiments that stay outside the normative grade.
UHBS evaluation (including AEP) is for **laboratory / sandbox use**, not real-world
production testing.

## Trust limits

- Mappings are informative. They do not certify frameworks or claim UHBS implements them.
- Prefer peer-reviewed or DOI-linked sources; label preprints and practitioner blogs.
- **Credit:** source authors and venues are acknowledged in the ledger below and in
  [AEP research foundations](../advanced-evidence/research-foundations.md); citation
  does not imply those authors endorse UHBS.
- UHQS, weights, δ_C, and letter grades are unchanged by this page.

## Concrete UHBS takeaways

### Adopt now (informative)

1. Evaluation-intent metadata (asset vs program vs campaign vs topology).
2. Engagement-yield metrics where sessions exist (MoE / Honeyval).
3. Attacker- and defender-cost reporting (ACI); tarpit delay may be beneficial in AEP while Module E still reports latency.
4. Cloud / decoy-object coverage gaps (CLOUDBURST + D3FEND).

### Experiment (Advanced Evidence Profile)

1. Paired decoy vs reference + evaluator control (Honeyval-style).
2. Fingerprinting Susceptibility Vector across network/protocol/system/state layers.
3. Dwell-Time Distortion Ratio and Exploit Exhaustion Rate under censored trials.
4. Value of Deception with an explicit utility model (not `delta_uhqs`).
5. ICS memory/register consistency probes.

### Map only / out of scope for UHQS

- CDMM, Cyber-Deception Chain, 7-Criteria, Belief-Scepticism, game-theoretic placement, MTD, and topology camouflage do not redefine Modules A–F.

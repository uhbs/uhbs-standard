Node.js FTP honeypot that accepts uploads into a pandora-box quarantine. Graded with the UHBS **ftp** plugin.

## What this decoy is

Lightweight FTP decoy for anonymous/auth FTP probing.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [FTP](ftp/index.md) | yes (`ftp`) | **yes** | [35.96 / F](ftp/quick/README.md) | [35.85 / F](ftp/full/README.md) |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Captures FTP login attempts and basic command probing from legacy worm/scanner ecosystems.
- Lower fidelity than medium-interaction FTP honeypots — good for presence/volume, not deep malware drop analysis alone.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** FTP USER/PASS, LIST/RETR attempts, client banners.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Disable real filesystem writes; use disposable storage if enabling uploads.
- Watch for bounce-scan / PORT abuse patterns if the implementation allows.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

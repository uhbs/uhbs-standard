# Methodology: Honeytrap UHBS lab

**UHBS:** 4.2.2 · Graded **SSH** only via standalone `config.uhbs-lab.toml` (ssh-simulator on **8022**).

Inventory uses host port **19102** on `127.0.0.1`. Module F scans `.local/labs/honeytrap` for static audit evidence.

## Evidence hierarchy

1. `full/SCORECARD.txt` when graded  
2. `full/report.json`  
3. This methodology (scope / blockers)  
4. Tutorial replication commands  

Skip hubs explain why no SCORECARD exists yet. See [READING-UHQS.md](../READING-UHQS.md). Informative only · UHBS 4.2.2 · isolate honeypot networks in real deployments.

## Analyst checklist

- Prefer published **full** SCORECARD artifacts when present; never invent UHQS for skip hubs.
- Confirm Safety Gate / δ_C before citing a composite score externally.
- Wire your own log shipping — Module C is harness visibility, not SIEM coverage.
- Re-run after upstream or TPS changes; keep class/protocol/target ids aligned with inventory.
- UHBS 4.2.2 remains an open-source evaluation framework (Apache-2.0) — informative proof only.

# miniprint — published UHBS lab reports

**Proof label:** [sa7mon/miniprint](https://github.com/sa7mon/miniprint)  
**Class / protocol:** `Low-Interaction` · PJL / raw TCP · port `9100`  
**UHBS:** 4.5.2 · evaluation proof only (not an endorsement)

miniprint is a **medium-interaction printer honeypot** that speaks Printer Job Language (PJL) on the classic raw print port. UHBS does not yet ship a first-class PJL RFC suite — Module A uses the **generic TCP** plugin under protocol id `pjl` (connect / banner / timing / fuzz). That limitation is documented so grades stay interpretable.

## Module snapshot (full)

| Module | Score | Highlight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Protocol | 65.4 | Generic PJL/TCP; high IAT jitter; **n=1000** samples |
| B Behavior | 62.5 | Survived binary blast; limited PJL state probes |
| C Telemetry | 55.0 | `miniprint.log` text — no STIX/OTel/ECS (capped) |
| D Containment | 90.0 | No remote shell listener configured; airgap + gateway; gate not cleared |
| E Scale | 55.0 | P95 ~1 s under concurrency 25 (single-threaded server) |
| F Static | 70.0 | Semgrep 1 critical → SAST gate cap |

## What this decoy is

Printer/PJL-oriented decoy graded via raw/PJL-style interaction.

## For CTI analysts

- Niche but real: attackers and scanners still probe print services.

**Primary signals:** PJL/raw print-path probes.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Useful canary on office VLANs where printers belong; any hit is suspicious.

## Trust & limitations

- Evaluation proof under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or endorsement.
- Prefer **full/** over **quick/** for decisions.

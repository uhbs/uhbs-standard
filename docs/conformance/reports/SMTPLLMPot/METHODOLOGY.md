# Methodology: SMTPLLMPot skip

**UHBS:** 4.5.2 · **SMTP** · **Status:** skipped (OpenAI LLM required)

LLM-backed SMTP cannot be exercised without API keys in this air-gapped grading policy.

See [READING-UHQS.md](../READING-UHQS.md).

## Evidence hierarchy (when graded later)

1. `full/SCORECARD.txt` — modules, UHQS, grade, δ_C
2. `full/report.json` — machine-readable
3. This methodology — scope and limits
4. Tutorial — replication commands

Until then, treat this page as a **skip / gap note**. See [READING-UHQS.md](../READING-UHQS.md).

## Trust

Informative only · UHBS 4.5.2 · not an endorsement. Isolate honeypot networks in real deployments; do not cite UHQS without SCORECARD proof.

## Environment note

Skip notes do not imply the upstream project is low quality — only that a reproducible UHBS lab grade was not completed under the constraints of this round (missing API keys, missing companion services, or unbuildable base images). Re-queue when a hermetic recipe exists. Prefer absolute docs-site URLs when sharing externally. UHBS remains an open-source evaluation framework (Apache-2.0, v4.2.2).

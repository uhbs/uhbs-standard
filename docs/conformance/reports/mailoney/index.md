Modern SMTP honeypot with credential capture and DB logging. Graded with the UHBS **smtp** plugin.

## What this decoy is

SMTP honeypot for spam/abuse and mail-oriented credential or relay abuse attempts.

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Collects SMTP dialogue useful for spam campaign tracking (MAIL FROM/RCPT TO, payloads when offered).
- Complements HTTP/SSH sensors for actors that still probe mail submission paths.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** SMTP commands, auth attempts, envelope senders/recipients, message submissions.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Never allow open relay to the Internet; confirm lab/production config rejects relay.
- Quarantine captured message bodies; they may contain malware URLs.
- Alert on AUTH attempts and unusual RCPT patterns; tune to avoid drowning in Internet background radiation.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

# Endlessh — published UHBS lab reports

**Proof label:** [skeeto/endlessh](https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh)  
**Class / protocol:** `Low-Interaction` · **ssh_tarpit** (generic TCP) · container port `2222`  
**UHBS:** 4.5.2 · evaluation proof only (not an endorsement)

Endlessh is an **SSH tarpit**: it accepts TCP and slowly drips random banner lines,
but **never** emits a valid `SSH-2.0-…` identification string. This grade uses the
**generic** plugin under protocol id `ssh_tarpit` — **not** the SSH/Paramiko plugin
(which hangs waiting for a handshake that never comes).

## Results at a glance

| Mode | UHQS | Grade | δ_C | Safety Gate | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Quick** | **46.55** | F | 0.5625 | not cleared (C=75) | [`quick/`](quick/README.md) |
| **Full** | **54.07** | D | 0.81 | not cleared (C=90) | [`full/`](full/README.md) |

Sanitized fixture (full): [`../../fixtures/endlessh-low-interaction.scorecard.json`](../../fixtures/endlessh-low-interaction.scorecard.json)

### Why full &gt; quick

Quick skips telemetry schema gates (optimistic C=100) and has weaker Module D
(airgap only → C=75, δ_C=0.5625). Full measures telemetry honestly (C=55), runs
SAST (F capped at 70), and records a clean gateway canary (D=90, δ_C=0.81).

**Takeaway:** prefer **full/**; do **not** grade Endlessh with `--protocol ssh`.

| D Containment | 90.0 | No `ports.ssh` → shell probes skipped; airgap + gateway |
| E Scale | 100.0 | 200 TCP connects @ concurrency 25; P95 ≪ 150 ms |
| F Static | 70.0 | Semgrep findings; SAST gate cap |

## What this decoy is

SSH tarpit that slowly drips banners to stall scanners (not a real SSH stack).

## For CTI analysts

- Useful for measuring sticky scanners; little post-banner CTI compared to interactive SSH honeypots.

**Primary signals:** Connection duration / tarpit engagement; not full SSH sessions.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Grade with UHBS `ssh_tarpit` / generic — never Paramiko `ssh` (will hang).
- Good cheap delay layer in front of real SSH sensors.

## Trust & limitations

- Evaluation proof under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or endorsement.
- Prefer **full/** over **quick/** for decisions.

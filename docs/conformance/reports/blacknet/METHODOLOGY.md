# Methodology: blacknet skip record

**UHBS:** 4.2.2 · **Result:** skipped (no UHQS)

## Skip reason

Blacknet 2 is a distributed SSH sensor architecture: each honeypot (`blacknet-sensor`) expects TLS to a `blacknet-master`, MySQL schema initialization, and PKI material. Standing that stack up reliably exceeds the ~20 minute lab budget without inventing scores, so no UHBS run was executed.

## Evidence

No `SCORECARD.txt` or `report.json` was generated. This page exists so readers do not confuse absence of scores with a perfect or unknown grade.

## Analyst checklist

- Prefer published **full** SCORECARD artifacts when present; never invent UHQS for skip hubs.
- Confirm Safety Gate / δ_C before citing a composite score externally.
- Wire your own log shipping — Module C is harness visibility, not SIEM coverage.
- Re-run after upstream or TPS changes; keep class/protocol/target ids aligned with inventory.
- UHBS 4.2.2 remains an open-source evaluation framework (Apache-2.0) — informative proof only.

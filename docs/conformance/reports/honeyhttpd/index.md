Python HTTP honeypot framework graded with the UHBS **http** plugin.

## What this decoy is

Configurable Python HTTP imitation server for web decoy pages/endpoints.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [HTTP](http/index.md) | yes | **yes** | [45.84 / F](http/quick/README.md) | [45.73 / F](http/full/README.md) |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Depends on configured site personality — CTI value scales with how convincingly paths/content match the lure.
- Captures generic web scanner traffic against the imitated surface.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** HTTP requests against configured imitation routes.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Treat templates as code: review for accidental SSRF/open-redirect if you customize handlers.
- Use distinct Host headers / TLS certs so analysts can filter decoy HTTP from production.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.1 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

# Conpot — published UHBS lab reports

**Proof label:** [mushorg/conpot](https://github.com/mushorg/conpot)  
**Class / protocol:** `ICS-SCADA` · Modbus TCP · container port `5020` (host map `502→5020`)  
**UHBS:** 4.5.1 · evaluation proof only (not an endorsement)

Conpot is an **ICS/SCADA honeypot** (default template also enables HTTP, S7, SNMP, BACnet, ENIP, FTP, TFTP, IPMI). This published grade evaluates the **Modbus** listener only — the primary ICS protocol plugin UHBS ships — so results stay comparable to other single-protocol lab reports.

## Module snapshot (full)

| Module | Score | Highlight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Protocol | 79.0 | Modbus plugin; FC03 holding-register read returns exception `0x02` (default map is coils/inputs); **n=1000** timing on 0–100 CheckResult scale |
| B Behavior | 42.5 | FC 0x06 write step failed/unacknowledged on default template; binary fuzz survived |
| C Telemetry | 55.0 | `conpot.log` text — no STIX/OTel/ECS (capped) |
| D Containment | 90.0 | No `ports.ssh`; airgap + gateway; gate not cleared |
| E Scale | 100.0 | P95 ~1.7 ms at concurrency **5** / 50 requests (moderated — see methodology) |
| F Static | 70.0 | Template SSL keys + Bandit HIGH findings → SAST gate cap |

## What this decoy is

ICS/SCADA honeypot; UHBS published Modbus proof among others.

## For CTI analysts

- Supports intel on ICS protocol scanners and unsafe Internet exposure of industrial protocols.

**Primary signals:** ICS protocol requests (e.g., Modbus) against the decoy.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Never bridge ICS honeypots to production OT networks.
- Treat any Modbus/S7-like traffic to the decoy as hostile reconnaissance.

## Trust & limitations

- Evaluation proof under UHBS 4.5.1 — not a certification or endorsement.
- Prefer **full/** over **quick/** for decisions.

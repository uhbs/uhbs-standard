| Protocol | Port | Quick | Full |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [SSH](ssh/index.md) (includes SFTP subsystem) | 2222 | 82.76 / B | 61.37 / D |

## What this decoy is

Medium-interaction SSH/Telnet honeypot widely used for interactive session and malware-download telemetry.

## For CTI analysts

- Rich post-auth command transcripts and downloaded malware samples (when enabled) support actor TTPs and tooling intel.
- SFTP/SCP may appear as SSH subsystems — UHBS grades SSH/Telnet plugins, not a separate SFTP protocol.

**Primary signals:** SSH/Telnet sessions, commands, downloaded artifacts, auth events.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Classic blue-team sensor: alert on successful auth to decoy creds and on outbound download behavior from the honeypot.
- Keep Cowrie isolated; downloaded malware must not reach production file shares.

## Trust & limitations

- Evaluation proof under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or endorsement.
- Prefer **full/** over **quick/** for decisions.

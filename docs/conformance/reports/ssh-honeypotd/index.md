Low-interaction C/libssh honeypot that logs authentication attempts and never grants a session.

## What this decoy is

Minimal low-interaction SSH listener (C) oriented at capturing connection/auth attempts.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [SSH](ssh/index.md) | yes (`ssh`) | **yes** | [44.38 / F](ssh/quick/README.md) | [44.38 / F](ssh/full/README.md) |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Targets mass SSH scanning and credential guessing rather than long interactive post-exploitation.
- Limited behavioral depth in UHBS (low B) — interpret as a credential/connection sensor, not a full adversary playground.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** Inbound SSH handshakes and auth attempts (implementation-dependent logging).

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Simple footprint for edge decoys; pair with external logging (syslog/file) before production use.
- Do not expose management interfaces of the host; containerize and drop capabilities.
- Low UHQS does not mean “ignore” — it means the decoy failed realism/telemetry bars under UHBS, not that attackers will never hit it.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

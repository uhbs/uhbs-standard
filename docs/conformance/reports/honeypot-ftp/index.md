## For CTI analysts

- Captures FTP credential and file-oriented probing.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** FTP auth and file commands.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Prefer disposable storage; monitor uploads for malware drops if enabled.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.2 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

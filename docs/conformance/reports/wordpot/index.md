WordPress fingerprint honeypot graded with the UHBS **http** plugin.

## What this decoy is

WordPress-themed HTTP honeypot for CMS scanner and plugin/theme probe capture.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [HTTP](http/index.md) | yes | **yes** | [41.71 / F](http/quick/README.md) | [41.6 / F](http/full/README.md) |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Tracks WordPress attack automation (wp-login, xmlrpc, plugin path probes).
- Useful for campaign clustering by requested plugin/CVE paths.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** HTTP paths for WP admin/login/xmlrpc/plugins; credential posts when logged.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Label clearly as decoy; do not host adjacent to real WordPress with shared DB/creds.
- Detect xmlrpc multicall and wp-login brute force patterns from the honeypot logs.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.1 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

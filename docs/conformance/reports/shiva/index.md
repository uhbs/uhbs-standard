## What this decoy is

SMTP spam honeypot (receiver-oriented) for capturing spam/abuse mail traffic.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Supports spam campaign and malware-delivery URL extraction from captured mail.
- Complements Mailoney-style SMTP sensors depending on deployment topology.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** SMTP sessions and message content captured by SHIVA receiver.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Quarantine and detonate attachments in isolated analysis — never on the honeypot OS.
- Confirm the graded lab was receiver-only; verify your deploy cannot relay.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.1 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

# GenAIPot (ls1911 / Nucleon)

**Status:** Informative · evaluation proof  
**Upstream:** [https://github.com/ls1911/GenAIPot](https://github.com/ls1911/GenAIPot) · tree from zip `205ffe40008f2e76e0decdb01bc19bf8e00acd8a`  
**Runtime:** Docker Hub [`annls/genaipot:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/annls/genaipot) (container banner **v0.9.2**, offline templates)

AI-assisted SMTP + POP3 mail honeypot (Twisted). Graded with UHBS in-tree `smtp` and `pop3` plugins in **offline** mode (pre-shipped response templates; no live LLM API).

## What this decoy is

AI-assisted mail decoy surfaces graded on SMTP and POP3 in UHBS labs.

## Protocol survey

| Surface | UHBS plugin? | Graded? | Quick | Full |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [SMTP](smtp/index.md) | yes | **yes** (offline Docker) | [30.9 / F](smtp/quick/README.md) | [30.78 / F](smtp/full/README.md) |
| [POP3](pop3/index.md) | yes | **yes** (offline Docker) | [44.24 / F](pop3/quick/README.md) | [44.13 / F](pop3/full/README.md) |

> Named product is evaluation proof only — not a UHBS endorsement.

## For CTI analysts

- Mail-protocol telemetry (SMTP/POP3) for actors probing mailbox services.

**Primary signals you can expect (when logging is wired):** SMTP/POP3 session behavior per graded listeners.

## For blue teams / detection engineering

- Confirm model/API dependencies for your deploy; UHBS grades used offline Docker templates where noted in methodology.

## Trust & limitations

- This page is **evaluation proof** under UHBS 4.5.1 — not a certification or vendor ranking.
- Prefer **full/** artifacts over **quick/** for operational decisions.
- Re-run via [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md); environment notes in [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

# Published grades (conformance)

**Status:** Normative (fixtures) / Informative (narrative + lab reports)

This section is **evaluation proof**: finished scorecards and Docker lab recipes
for named honeypots. It is **not** the “how to install UHBS” guide.

!!! tip "Looking for install / CLI steps?"
    Start here instead: **[Install & use UHBS](../tooling/install-and-use.md)**.

| Page type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Report hub** | Published quick / full UHQS for one product |
| **Reproduce grade** | Exact Docker commands used to produce that grade |
| **Methodology** | Trust notes / provenance for the run |

Fixtures and **published lab reports** are the only place in the public docs
where specific deception products are named — as evaluation proof (not as UHBS
requirements).

Optional controlled comparative evidence (VoD / FSV / DTDR / EER) lives in the
[Advanced Evidence Profile](../advanced-evidence/index.md) and does **not** alter
these UHQS fixtures.

uhbs validate-scorecard docs/conformance/fixtures/espot-web-api.scorecard.json --strict

```

## Relationship to the lab harness

Fixtures and reports were produced by `uhbs_core.run_benchmark` (Modules A–F)
and verified with `compute_uhqs`. See [reference-implementation.md](../reference-implementation.md)
and the per-honeypot [reports](reports/index.md).

**Naming policy:** Outside this conformance tree, docs and templates MUST use
decoy **classes** and **protocols** only (see repository `GOVERNANCE.md`).
